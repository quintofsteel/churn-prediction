## Predicting Customer Churn for a Telecommunications Company

In this project, we will use machine learning to analyze customer data and predict which customers are likely to churn, allowing the company to take preventative measures.
<br/>
<br/>
Specifically, we will be working with a dataset from a telecommunications company containing information on customer demographics, account information, and service usage. 
<br/>
<br/>
Our goal is to build a model that can accurately predict whether a customer will churn or not.
