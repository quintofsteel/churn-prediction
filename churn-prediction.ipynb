    "## Introduction\n",
    "Telecommunications companies rely heavily on customer retention to maintain their profitability. Losing customers to competitors can result in significant revenue loss, especially considering the high acquisition costs associated with attracting new customers. Therefore, it is crucial for these companies to identify customers who are at risk of churning and take proactive measures to retain them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this portfolio project, we will use machine learning to analyze customer data and predict which customers are likely to churn, allowing the company to take preventative measures. Specifically, we will be working with a dataset from a telecommunications company containing information on customer demographics, account information, and service usage. Our goal is to build a model that can accurately predict whether a customer will churn or not.\n",
